Some various papers on his body pending translation, as well as what seems to be a snippet from a poem on a slip of paper. The poem is, oddly enough, not in Novikan. The snippet seems to have suffered some damage, although we are unsure whether this was deliberate. Refer to evidence piece <a href="#evidenceA1">A1</a> below. Further analysis pending.</th>

            <td class="entry">Transmission intercepted from Novikan forces. Their command chain is having trouble finding an operational foothold due to unpredictable local insurgency. Keep up the good work, folks. In other news, armor is landing and mobilizing along the western coast of Cappamore and Eritrea. It would seem that a small number of locals in Portlaoise, North Bay, and Underwood have defected as intel officers to Novik. A select few of these individuals stand to pose a serious threat in combat as well, namely those who follow: "cloud" in Portlaoise, "sumpter" in west Androth, and "quill" in Underwood. Any operatives in these areas are advised to exersise extreme caution when confronting these individuals. More news to follow.</td>
